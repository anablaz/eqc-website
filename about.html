    <h1>About the European Quidditch Cup</h1>
    <p class="par">The European Quidditch Cup is the club championship in European quidditch. Community and school teams
        from across the continent qualify through national championships and leagues, and come together between March
        and May to fight for the title of European Champion across two divisions. </p>
    <p class="par">Meanwhile, the new Division 2 tournament of EQC saw a German matchup for the finals, where the Berlin
        Bluecaps managed to secure victory over Looping Lux Leipzig to become the first ever Division 2 winners.
        Congratulations to the Bluecaps, but also to the rest of the German teams; all four attending teams managed to
        rank within the top 5!</p>
